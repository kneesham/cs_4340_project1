### 1. How the data points were generated (training and test):
  - The training points were made with sklearn.datasets make_blobs function and their centers were placed  so that we would be guarenteed the linearly separable case.
  - The test points were also made with sklearn.datasets make_blobs function but their centers were placed  so that we wouldn't be guarenteed the linearly separable case.
### 2. Are training data points are linearly separable?:
  - First case: Yes, our has training points that are set initially such that we would be guarenteed linear separability every time.
  - Second case: No, our training points that are never guarenteed linear separability.
### 3. NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED.
### 4. Our initial choice of the weights and constants:
  - Eta = 0.01
  - passes = 1000
  - 1 <=  weights >= 0
### 5, 6. Number of weight updates, final boundry line:
  - SEE OUTPUT.
### 7. the total number of iterations made over the training set(an iteration involves checking each of the training points and determining its class as given by the line):
  - How do we do this?
### 8. the final misclassification error, if any(expressed as a percentage), on the training data as well ason the test data:
  - Again I am not entirely sure how to do this part.
